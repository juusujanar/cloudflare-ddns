# CloudFlare Dynamic DNS

Tired of having to update your DNS every time your dynamic IP changes?

This app ensures your DNS records get updated at an hourly interval. IPs are collected using https://www.ipify.org/.
Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported, however IPv6 must be explicitly turned on for each domain.

If you enable IPv6 and run the Docker container, your
[Docker must have IPv6 connectivity](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/ipv6/).
Do take note IPv6 address might be different for the container and the service you want to access.

App is built using Golang 1.13 and final Docker container is based on `scratch`.
Starting from version 2.0, images are also available for arm64 and arm/v7 (all under same tag)
in addition to the usual amd64.

Latest image (janarj/cloudflare-ddns:latest) may contain unstable versions.
Use versioned image tags for stable releases (janarj/cloudflare-ddns:2.0)

Versions 1.x are no longer supported (previously made in Bash and ran on Alpine).


## How to use

Config file must be in one of the following locations:
- /etc/cf-ddns
- $HOME/.cf-ddns
- same directory as the binary

and be named config.json, config.yml or config.toml.
JSON and YAML examples are in configs folder.
Detailed information is below.

### To use Docker image:

  -v $PWD/config.json:/etc/cf-ddns/config.json \ 
  janarj/cloudflare-ddns:2.0
```

### Or if you want to build it yourself:
- `go build -o ./app ./cmd/cloudflare-ddns`
- Run the app binary with `./app`.
